PostCSS is a post-processor

=

How does a post-processor differs from a pre-processor?

=

A pre-processor takes any language and outputs CSS

=

A post-processor takes in CSS and outputs anything (including CSS).

=

PostCSS at its core is a
- CSS Parser
- An AST for CSS
- AST walkers

=

The useful is provided by plugins

=

There are plugins for
- Variable interpolation
- Vendor Prefixes
- CSS modules
- etc

=

So what is an AST?

=

Abstract syntax tree

=

Why abstract syntax?

=

var x = 1

var    x    = 1;


maps to the same AST

=

Because it presents the code as a data structure it is easier to modify than code as text.

=

# Examples of types of nodes used by PostCSS
=

Root

=

Declaration

=

Rule

=

What AST Walkers

=

They abstract the details of walking through the graph for the programmer
